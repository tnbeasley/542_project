# 542 Final Project: Predicting Bankruptcy
This project seeks to predict whether a company will go bankrupt based on financial metrics as well as explore if there are any metrics that strongly drive bankruptcy.

The files in the repo contain various functions that perform a variety of tasks. 

Ultimately, you may want to start by analyzing the currently created models with the ModelAnalysis.py file.

Then, if you would like to create new models, you can run the CreateModels.py file which pulls from many of the other files to pull in the data, transform it as needed, and fit the appropriate models.

After fitting the models, you will likely want to run the CreatePartialDependences.py file which will conduct partial dependence analysis on all the models and output the results into the PartialDependence folder.

If you have any further questions about the code, feel free to reach out to any of the contributors in the GitHub repo.
